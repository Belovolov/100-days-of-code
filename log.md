# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: September 18, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I've started working on personal portfolio freeCodeCamp project

**Thoughts** After making my real porfolio but with the use of React I am confident I can finish this project soon.

**Link(s) to work**
1. [Build a Personal Portfolio Webpage](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-personal-portfolio-webpage)

### Day 2: September 19, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Proceed with portfolio, projects part

**Thoughts** Conveting React to plain HTML/JS is tedious. Makes it easy to understand how React is awesome
